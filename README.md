# retakes_allocator_plus
A weapon-allocator for splewis' retakes plugin, based on his original weapon-allocator.

**Careful, I made this plugin for personal use, I take no responsibility for what you do with it!**

## Installation
You **need** to have [retakes by splewis](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-retakes) installed.
Then just drop the .smx file from the [release](https://github.com/dev-viinz/retakes_allocator_plus/releases) in the plugins folder and restart/refresh/reload (whatever suits you best).

## Contributing
I won't make a guide for this, if you know how to contribute, feel free to PR though!

## Roadmap
- ~~Make AWP chance based (20%)~~
- ~~Add possibility to choose pistols~~
- ~~Add pistol rounds (every 5 rounds)~~
- Random pistol choice
- *Maybe* add more options to rifles
